* Dotfiles

Some configuration files I use on multiple machines.

** Bash
   Collection of bash functions/aliases/settings I use. Bulk of functions are in [[file:bash/main.sh][main.sh]], with private stuff in [[file:bash/private.sh][private.sh]] (obviously not tracked by git). If [[file:bash/main.sh][main.sh]] ever gets too disorganized, I'll likely branch it into functions.sh, aliases.sh, etc. I source all of these into my session at startup through the following code in my ~/.bashrc:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     # Load in my custom configuration
     if [[ -d ~/dotfiles/bash ]]; then
         for file in ~/dotfiles/bash/*; do
             . "$file"
         done
     fi
   #+END_SRC

** Vim
   vim configuration file. ~/.vimrc is a symlink to this

** Spacemacs
  [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] configuration. Uses symlinks similar to with vim above.
